# Edvin Martinsson
I am a 24-year-old product design student originally from Värnamo. 
In 2022, my partner and I moved to Mölndal to pursue our studies.
I am currently in my second year of the Product Design programme at Chalmers University of Technology.

I have a strong interest in product design and the product development process.
I enjoy solving practical design challenges through my coursework and in my spare time.
Now I am looking to extend this interest to a practical real-world proffesional setting.
Thank you for visiting my webpage hope that the contents will be of interest to you.

# Computer Aided Design
I have experience in both parametric and surface modeling CAD software.
I first learned CAD in upper secondary school where I used Solidworks for three years.
Unfortunately all these files were lost due to a computer failure.
This was a good learning experience as I am a lot better at file management now.
At chalmers I have learned CATIA in which I am really comfortable with now.
I am also getting better at Alias that is a quite different software than what I am used to.
My curriculum promises further training in Alias.
I have tried out Fusion 360 out of pure curiosity. This is probably the software
I would use if I would not have access to any student licenses.

      An exercise focusing on learning basic commands in CATIA and choosing the optimal path 
      to create parts. The parts of the food processor where created by reading technical drawings.

### Tackle box - CAD Course
The aim of this project was to build a box of your choosing with at least one cantilever shelf.
Another aspect of this project was to get familiar with standardized parts and to include them in
the build when applicable.

### Frida - Design Methodology
The resulting product of a designing methodology group project. The group was tasked with developing a product
aimed to improve the school environment. The basis of the project came from trend analysis and student 
surveys and interviews. Throughout this project there was a strong emphasis on utilizing different ideation methods
and iterating each concept several times.

### Forwarder Crane - A mechanics project
The purpose of this project was to build a rough model of a forwarder crane and showcase its functions in CATIA.
Then we ran static equilibrium calculations on the crane to ensure that it could lift the specified load of 250 kg.

### Push-cart - An ergonomics project
In this group project we were tasked with identifying an ergonoomics problem and then solving it.
Through a field study at Colorama Stenkullen we identified a problem they had which was postural strain while doing heavy lifting.
We set out to solve this problem through further developing their existing push-cart.
By executing several strain analyses we could identify what needed improvement.
The first image is the existing push-cart and the two following is our design.
Our design reduces strain produced by the cart and when lifting heavy provided that the user applies proper lifting techniques.
It allows the user to higher and lower the handle and shelf of the cart to an optimal pushing and lifting height reducing strain on the lower back, arms, legs and wrists.

### Bentley Municipal - a city car concept
Disclaimer: This project is in no way affiliated with Bentley Motors.

In this challenging but highly rewarding individual project I was tasked with designing the exterior of a new compact and electric city car.
My assigned car company was Bentley and the intended target audience was individuals under the age of 30.
I identified a few of Bentleys key design elements and then designed the car with these in mind.
The outcome was a 2-seater electric liftback that balances luxury and practicality.

## BenchTable
A dual purpose picnic table/bench for smaller patios. A practical table that can be transformed and
concealed as a bench when the table part is not needed.

## Fume extractor
This is the concept of an affordable fume extractor visualized in Autodesk Fusion.
Fumes are extracted with a fan attached to the exhaust tube in the back.
Users can switch between extracting fumes with the grate or the flexible tube.
The tube is for when the gas is concentrated and origins from a small area.
The most common use case is for soldering.
The grate is for when the gas is spread out and the tube is not sufficient.
For example washing mechanical parts with harsh chemicals or smaller paint jobs.

## 3D-Printning
My Friend graciously gifted me this Vertex Velleman K8400 3D-Printer.
It required quite a bit of tinkering before producing a successful print.
When finally dialing in layer heights, thread height and much more one problem remained.
The problem is insufficient cooling resulting in warped layers and surfaces which i hope to resolve soon.
Two successful prints are the wheels in the Bentley Municial project and prototypes in the Frida project.
